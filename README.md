For the assignment we used unity to store and collaborate our project in real time. (Our commits are all on unity!) We also used blender to make a large number of the assets used such as boulders, the spiders and various other objects. For audio creation and manipulaiton we used reaper. We also used some software to draw and design the pause menu.

Michael's project contribution:
I implemented and worked on a number of features such as the spawning of enemies, vision range and balance to shooting bullets and bug fixing errors. I also created a number of assets in blender and worked on the animations for the enemies and a number of interactions. I also built and designed the level and lightning particle effects.
